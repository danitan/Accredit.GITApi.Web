This is a simple web app that seeks to query users in Github user api (primarily using this endpoint: https://api.github.com/users/robconery).

To run, simply open Visual studio and press F5 (for debug and run website) or ctrl + f5 (for simple run). Once you reach the web page you will land on the search page, where you will be asked to input the username you wish to search for.
